### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Abhishek

I'm a Software Engineer at Tableau in Seattle where I work with fullstack technologies to build new data analysis tools. Previously I was a student at the University of Washington.

In my free time I love learning about technologies and economics, building side projects, trying to make a dent in my reading list, and finding the best bakeries in the city.
